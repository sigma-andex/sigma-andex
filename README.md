Hi,

I'm Jan, a deep learning and functional programming enthusiast. I code mostly in Rust, TypeScript and Python, though I also have strong experience in PureScript, Haskell, Scala and Idris.

Right now I'm mostly interested in LLMs with a focus on making LLMs fast and accessible.

I'm **available for hire**, reach out to me at https://betalyra.pt/contact.

## Current projects

At the moment I'm working on the following projects:

- [`@betalyra/sorry-dave`](https://github.com/betalyra/sorry-dave) - Typescript authorization library
- [`@huggingface/ratchet`](https://github.com/huggingface/ratchet) - Contributor to [Christopher's](https://github.com/FL33TW00D) ratchet transformer library.

## Further projects

### Purescript

- 🔭 [`barlow-lens`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-barlow-lens) - A lens library that makes creating complex lenses such as record lenses super simple
- 🐆 [`fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-fast-vect) - Fast, type-safe vector libary for Purescript inspired by Idris.
- 🪁 [`httpurple`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-httpurple) - A simple, type-safe http server for PureScript. Originally forked from [`httpure`](https://github.com/citizennet/purescript-httpure) but since then has deviated quite a bit.
- 🍒 [`morello`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-morello) - Cherry-picking for your data.

#### 🧘🏾‍♀️ rowtype-yoga

Apart from these, I have published a couple of libraries that I have donated and moved to the [🧘🏾‍♀️ rowtype-yoga](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/) organisation. Here is an excerpt, you can find more on the [organisation's profile](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/):

- 💌 [fetch](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fetch) - A minimalist library for using fetch (aka browser http client) in PureScript
- 📀 [record-studio](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-record-studio) - Working with records made easy
- 🧮 [js-bigints](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-js-bigints) - FFI bindings for native `BigInt`
- 🦥 [lazy-joe](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-lazy-joe) - Purescript ffi for the lazy joe
- 🦾 [fallback](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fallback) - Idris-style fallback for do comprehensions.

### Scala

- 🐆 [`fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/scala-fast-vect) - Fast, type-safe vector libary for Scala. A port of my [`purescript-fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-fast-vect) and also heavily inspired by Idris.

### Rust

- 🤖 [`skriptorium`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/skriptorium) - A proof-of-concept for a cli to generate documentation for a repository using OpenAI.

### Idris

- ⚗️ [`idris-refined`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/idris-refined) - Refinement types for idris using dependent pairs.
