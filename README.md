Hi there! 

I'm Jantxu, a functional programming geek and deep learning enthusiast. I code mostly in PureScript, Haskell, Scala but also got experience with TypeScript, Rust, Python, Idris. I currently work as a freelance full-stack developer and am available for hire. 

I've published a bunch of open source libraries;

## Purescript
* 🔭 [`barlow-lens`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-barlow-lens) - A lens library that makes creating complex lenses such as record lenses super simple
* 🐆 [`fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-fast-vect) - Fast, type-safe vector libary for Purescript inspired by Idris.
* 🪁 [`httpurple`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-httpurple) - A simple, type-safe http server for PureScript. Originally forked from [`httpure`](https://github.com/citizennet/purescript-httpure) but since then has deviated quite a bit. 
* 🍒 [`morello`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-morello) - Cherry-picking for your data.

### 🧘🏾‍♀️ rowtype-yoga

Apart from these, I have published a couple of libraries that I have donated and moved to the [🧘🏾‍♀️ rowtype-yoga](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/) organisation. Here is an excerpt, you can find more on the [organisation's profile](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/):

* 💌 [fetch](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fetch) - A minimalist library for using fetch (aka browser http client) in PureScript
* 📀 [record-studio](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-record-studio) - Working with records made easy
* 🧮 [js-bigints](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-js-bigints) - FFI bindings for native `BigInt`
* 🦥 [lazy-joe](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-lazy-joe) - Purescript ffi for the lazy joe
* 🦾 [fallback](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fallback) - Idris-style fallback for do comprehensions.

## Scala
* 🐆 [`fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/scala-fast-vect) - Fast, type-safe vector libary for Scala. A port of my [`purescript-fast-vect`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/purescript-fast-vect) and also heavily inspired by Idris.

## Rust
* 🤖 [`skriptorium`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/skriptorium) - A proof-of-concept for a cli to generate documentation for a repository using OpenAI.

## Idris
* ⚗️ [`idris-refined`](https://github.com/sigma-andex/idris-refined) - Refinement types for idris using dependent pairs.
